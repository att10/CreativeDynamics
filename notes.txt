Discrete Dynamics - time is an integer

Linear map on R2 - col vector = 2x2 * col vector
rotations and dilation - angle preserving, conformal
dilation [(a, 0), (0, a)]
rotation [(cosx, -sinx), (sinx, cosx)]
Matrix is a rotation and dilation iff A = D and B = -C
F is conformal at (x0,y0) if du/dx=dv/dy and du/dy=-dv/dx where d is del

R2 Vectors
AB is a vector, ||AB|| = ||A|| ||B|| and angles sum

Complex Dynamics
F(z) = z^2 + c
z = x + iy
c = alpha + beta*i
Filled in Julia Set: {z | F(z) !-> infinity}
connected or cantor
connected iff z = 0 does not go to infinity
cantor iff z = 0 goes to infinity

throw away |  keep

fixed point: z=f(z)
for z^2 - 1, fixed point is z = golden ratio

omega limit set of x
A is an attractor for f is A=W(x) for a big set of x

basin of attraction for A is the set of all x with W(x)=A

sensitive dependence to initial conditions

chaos: system where this goes on all over

lorenz water wheel, lorenz attractor

devaney's chaos:
1. sensitive dependence to initial conditions
2. topological transitivity
3. periodic points and dense

-----THURSDAY-------------------------------------------------------------------

a chaotic system is in a perpetual state of instability, which may be continual
  or episodic

divergence is exponential

EXERCISE: # rice on last spot on chess board: 9.223372036854775808 Ã— 10^18.
1 pound is approximately 29,000 grains. so there are 3.1804731e+14 pounds of
rice on the last square.
where would the 5lb bag of rice go:
5 pounds is 145000. logbase2(145000) is about 17.145, so the 18th position

characteristic lyapunon exponent (cle)

chaos means there is an attractor with a positive cle
