Discrete Dynamics - time is an integer

Linear map on R2 - col vector = 2x2 * col vector
rotations and dilation - angle preserving, conformal
dilation [(a, 0), (0, a)]
rotation [(cosx, -sinx), (sinx, cosx)]
Matrix is a rotation and dilation iff A = D and B = -C
F is conformal at (x0,y0) if du/dx=dv/dy and du/dy=-dv/dx where d is del

R2 Vectors
AB is a vector, ||AB|| = ||A|| ||B|| and angles sum

Complex Dynamics
F(z) = z^2 + c
z = x + iy
c = alpha + beta*i
Filled in Julia Set: {z | F(z) !-> infinity}
connected or cantor
connected iff z = 0 does not go to infinity
cantor iff z = 0 goes to infinity
